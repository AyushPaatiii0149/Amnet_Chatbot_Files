*Complex Event Processing*
Discover hard-to-find opportunities or threats from high-volume, rapidly occurring data spanning departments and different sources to achieve high operational intelligence. We help you define, manage, and predict events, situations, exceptional conditions, opportunities, and threats in complex, heterogeneous networks.

*Deep Learning*
Control the power of unstructured data such as images, text, and speech to give transformative use cases that leverage techniques like AI, image analysis, natural language processing, and more. We use layered algorithms for the models to draw conclusions similar to humans and assist in AI consulting, engineering, training, support, and custom software development.

*Graph Analysis*
Improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms with pre-connected data in graph models, enabling relationships of numerous degrees of separation to be traversed and analyzed quickly at scale.

*NLP (Natural Language Processing)*
Understand, interpret, and process natural human language with advanced machine learning models to build products that understand your customers better. We integrate or build powerful NLP applications that let you gain actionable insights from vast unstructured data sets using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and linguistics.

*Pattern Matching*
Recognize and extract specific types of entities in sequences of data of some pattern among raw data or a sequence of tokens. We assist in the digitalization of historic & current documents and images to determine the existence of specified subjects.

*Sentiment Analysis*
